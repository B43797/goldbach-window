# The Goldbach Window — A Robust, Constructive Route to Two Primes

**Status:** Public preprint  
**Author:** Bahbouhi Bouchaib (Independent Scientist)

## Description
This repository presents a constructive Goldbach Window:  
for every large even number E = 2x, a short logarithmic-size list of offsets t — ranked by a scoring function Σ** — reliably contains a prime pair (x − t, x + t).

The method combines local congruence geometry (Σ_dense), a tempered Hardy–Littlewood lift, and a light two-column Selberg-style refinement.  
Stress-style tests (primorial/CRT) indicate the window remains short and robust.

**One sentence:**  
The Goldbach Window turns “there exist two primes” into a short, reliable list that consistently contains them.
