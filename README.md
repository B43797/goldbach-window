# The Goldbach Window ‚Äî A Robust, Constructive Route to Two Primes

**Status:** Public preprint  
**Author:** Bahbouhi Bouchaib (Independent Scientist)

## Description
This repository presents a constructive Goldbach Window:  
for every large even number E = 2x, a short logarithmic-size list of offsets t ‚Äî ranked by a scoring function Œ£** ‚Äî reliably contains a prime pair (x ‚àí t, x + t).

The method combines local congruence geometry (Œ£_dense), a tempered Hardy‚ÄìLittlewood lift, and a light two-column Selberg-style refinement.  
Stress-style tests (primorial/CRT) indicate the window remains short and robust.
